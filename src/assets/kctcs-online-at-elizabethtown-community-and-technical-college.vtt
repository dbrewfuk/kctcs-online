00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.280
Christine: I would say that going
online, if it changes what

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.180
you're able to do, it makes the
difference between being able to

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.700
go to school and not being able
to go to school, you should

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.720
absolutely do it.

5
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.109
And there's never a better time
to start then now.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.390
I'm Christine Watts and I earned
my degree online at

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.610
Elizabethtown, Community and
Technical College.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.780
My husband was in the army, and
we got stationed out here at

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.630
Fort Knox. And then after he
decided to get out off of active

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.180
duty and switch to the reserve
units, we decided to stay

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.080
because we liked the area. What
probably led me to ECTC first

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.750
was the fact that my husband
actually signed up for school

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
first. And then once he started
looking into it, I started

14
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.770
looking into the classes
available as well. For me and my

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.150
experience, it's literally a
chance to start over again. You

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.050
know, I dropped out of college
at 18 years old, I got married,

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.060
I had five children. And for me
it was a stepping stone to get

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.850
back softly into being a student
again. So the flexibility really

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
gave me the opportunity to take
care of my family at a level

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.680
where they weren't missing me,
but still furthering myself. But

21
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.120
I do believe that the way ECTC
is set up, it's very inviting.

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.200
When you join the program and
you get enrolled, they send you

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.320
text messages, they're like,
hey, it's enrollment time. This

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140
is what we can do for you. Hey,
we just started the semester.

25
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.080
Have you made contact with your
professors? They check in with

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.030
you and they make sure that
you're set up for success

27
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
through the entire program. You
can feel it in the way they set

28
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900
up their programs that they want
you to succeed
