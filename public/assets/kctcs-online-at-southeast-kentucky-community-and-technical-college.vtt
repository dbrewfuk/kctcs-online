00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Emily: distance has not made
any kind of difference in the

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.360
care and compassion that you
receive from your instructors at

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.200
any time. I mean, I can call I
can email, anything that I need.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.500
I know that somebody's there,
regardless of where I'm at. I'm

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.230
Emily Sargent and I earned my
degree online at Southeast

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.550
Kentucky Community and Technical
College. I studied my Associates

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.050
in Science here at se post
graduation, I am wanting to go

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.860
and get my farm D. And I will be
attending South College of

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.220
Pharmacy in Knoxville,
Tennessee, there are several big

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.490
advantages. The first would
probably be the cost. I was a

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
kid that didn't have financial
items. And I had to pay my way

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.980
through all of this. And it
definitely wasn't like going to

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.800
a big university where I would
have a lot of data, I'm able to

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.680
graduate pretty much debt free
because I was able to afford the

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.770
programs here. The second would
probably be the flexibility, I

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.370
was able to have other part time
to a full time job. And it's not

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.340
like I put my college education
on the backburner. But it

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.730
definitely gave me the ability
to do other things if I wanted

19
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.510
to. You definitely had to be
organized and put together and

20
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.420
be a little bit scheduled in
your own life, but it really

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.600
helped me. I would definitely
say that if you were thinking

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
about enrolling in online
classes, try it. It's not for

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.420
everybody. Some people don't
learn that great in the

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.500
classroom. I surely didn't. And
so being online, definitely

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
helped me achieve my goals based
on how I learned don't count out

26
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.390
the small community college. You
know, most people will think

27
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.840
that just to have a reputable
degree, you have to go to some

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.720
college or university that is
prestigious that would cost you

29
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.330
a lot of money. When you can get
the same thing here. Just

30
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.840
because you were in a certain
situation doesn't mean that

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.510
there's not resources and
programs out there that can't

32
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.600
help you an online program can
really help you achieve those

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.040
goals that you have no matter
what
