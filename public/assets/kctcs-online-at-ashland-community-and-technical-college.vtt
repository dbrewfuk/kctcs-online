Drew: Hello, I'm Drew
McKinney, and I graduated this

2
00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.579
year. I'm from the Asheville
area was born in Kings ours. My

3
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.389
name is Janice Osborne Dowdy and
I am a speech language

4
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.009
pathologist. I work with
individuals that have sustained

5
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.079
an acquired brain injury. And I
have had the pleasure of working

6
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.879
with Drew McKinney, throughout
the last several years in his

7
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.579
process of returning to school
through KCTCS online and taking

8
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.929
the classes that he has to help
him to meet his goal to finish

9
00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.129
his college degree Drew is a
walking miracle when he

10
00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.249
sustained his injury in the year
2010. He was in a coma for five

11
00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.149
and a half months though not
only has he been a survivor of

12
00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.359
this injury, but he is thriving
the KCTCS program online and all

13
00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.859
of the individuals who service
this program have helped Dru

14
00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:07.019
become that sort of thriver and
I think he is he is definitely

15
00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:12.209
unstoppable and they have been a
huge component of giving him a

16
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.719
launching pad all of the
individuals that are involved in

17
00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.739
KCTCS online, really were
trying to go above and beyond

18
00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.319
for their students. And I feel
like that isn't something that

19
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.839
is necessarily just exclusive to

20
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.679
each individual. It's very
flexible for being able to take

care of your other life
responsibilities, be it being an

22
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.479
a full time rehabilitation
program. Being a parent being a

23
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.209
full time employee Drew was one
of the folks who you would walk

24
00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.959
in and you would think he's he's
not going to survive, let alone

25
00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.399
to look at 13 years later, he
walked across the stage to get a

26
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.659
college degree.
