00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Unknown: My name is Jay Freeman.
And I chose to take online

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.440
classes at KCTCS. Because I have
three children, and I have to

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
work to support those children.
And I needed to get an education

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.380
that worked around my schedule,
which is busy. I had my own

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.030
online business that I ran for
four years. And I did that from

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.680
home. And then COVID hit, which
made it really hard to continue

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.590
on with that. So I made the
decision to shut that business

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
down. And I had to figure out
what I was going to do with my

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
life from there. So I thought
the best place to start is

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
school KCTCS was definitely
worth my time. And that same day

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
I called advising, they set me
up a time to come meet with

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.180
them. I walked out with my
schedule in my hand, it was

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.030
super easy. I actually had some
credits from before, they were

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.330
easy to transfer in, I got
credit for all of those classes,

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
I was able to easily fit school
into my schedule, around my kids

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.360
sports around my job, I would
get off work in the afternoon,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.540
and beat my kids home before
they got off school. And I would

18
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.080
spend a few hours doing homework
then. And then I got to run them

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040
around to sports and get them to
bed and get them fed. And then

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.050
after all of that I can hop back
on on my laptop and access my

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.400
classes and get some more work
done. KCTCS online helped me be

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.120
successful by making everything
really easy and streamlined.

23
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.330
Everything's in the Blackboard
app. It's easy to get to your

24
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.080
assignments. It's nice to be
able to view your professors

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.140
give you lectures, and take
notes so that you can be

26
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
prepared for your tests. I
majored in criminal justice, I

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.030
would like to continue on to law
school one day, being a

28
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.040
successful student at KCTCS
definitely helped me advance my

29
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
career. I did start at the
bookstore as a part time

30
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.430
employee. And shortly after I
graduated and was asked to be

31
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.880
the commencement speaker at
graduation, I was then promoted.

32
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.100
It was just really easy. It was
easy to fit into my schedule. It

33
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.260
was easy to keep my kids first.
It was easy to continue working.

34
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.420
But I definitely felt like I was
part of a school. I felt the

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.460
school spirit I felt the
camaraderie of my peers and it

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.780
was a really great experience.

37
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.050
