00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.199
Kathy: There is no way that I
could have completed my degree.

2
00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.919
If I had to go in person and do
traditional classrooms. I was

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.429
able to work late at night or
get up early and my teachers

4
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.989
were so accessible. But I did
have to overcome the nervousness

5
00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.049
of going back wondering if I
could actually do it. The

6
00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:23.639
faculty and staff at
Madisonville were a big asset to

7
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:28.769
me. My name is Kathy Markham. I
attended Madisonville Community

8
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.549
College and the program I took
was Paralegal Technology.

9
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.749
Apparently goal is a person that
is supports a practicing

10
00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.899
attorney, I can do all the
research, I can write the

11
00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.459
papers, I can do the legal work,
anything that an attorney needs.

12
00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.259
I was already a legal assistant
for about two years. And I

13
00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:53.159
wanted to continue my
opportunities to get more money

14
00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.939
and to advance my career. So
that's why I sought out the

15
00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.469
paralegal program. I chose the
online program because of its

16
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.599
flexibility. I could use the
time that I had, whether it be

17
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.419
late at night or early in the
morning to complete my

18
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:13.079
assignments. I thought that
being an online student was

19
00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.669
perfect for someone with my
schedule. As an online student,

20
00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:22.439
I also had access with my
advisor on a regular basis, and

21
00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.569
they made sure that I was on
point to graduate. It is true. I

22
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.529
was named Student Of The Year of
Madisonville Community College.

23
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.699
But I was very surprised it was
rewarding. Humbly I received it

24
00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:39.509
of course, with much gratitude,
but that award only came because

25
00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.229
of the faculty and staff support
I received well laughs does

26
00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.219
sometimes throw you a curveball.
So in my last semester I was

27
00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.599
diagnosed with breast cancer.
And in the late part of a

28
00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.379
January I had to have the
surgery and both breast and have

29
00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.989
reconstruction. Well, I would
have thought that I've just have

30
00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.439
to stop all all my classes and
stop my progress and that I

31
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.429
would not get to graduate with
my class how ever the faculty

32
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.269
and staff are the reason I was
able to complete my degree on

33
00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.579
time. I work at a law firm in
Kentucky now that I completed my

34
00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.929
degree on my title switch from
legal assistant to a paralegal

35
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.329
and also got a pay increase
which is wonderful. If I want to

36
00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.219
give advice to anyone that wants
to take online classes at

37
00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.669
Madisonville, I would say do it
without hesitation
