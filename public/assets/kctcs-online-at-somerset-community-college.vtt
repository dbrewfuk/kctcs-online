00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Stacy: I feel like SEC has
been bottle and taking my career

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.720
to the next level. It has opened
up so many opportunities with

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.850
the different positions that
I've been able to hold for the

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.060
last few years at Firestone
continuing my education and has

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.000
been an absolute key. I'm
currently the distribution

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.580
center coordinator at Firestone
air out here in Waynesburg,

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
Kentucky our plant creates and
manufactures or springs for

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.370
tractor, trailers, buses,
trains, things like that. My job

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.570
history at Firestone goes back
24 years, I started out in

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
production on the plant floor
manufacturing those air springs,

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.850
I was able to get a job in the
test lab, making sure that

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
everything was a good quality,
then started my journey at SCC

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.280
and was able to acquire a
document control coordinator job

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.570
which led into now that I'm
distribution center coordinator.

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610
What drew me to attend Somerset
Community College was needing to

16
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.700
go back to school, I had always
had a dream ever since I was in

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.900
high school to be able to go to
college and acquire a degree. No

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.600
one in my family and my in my
immediate family had a degree

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.930
and that's just something that I
had always wanted. So I searched

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
around and I saw that the
tuition and things for ACC were

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.610
remarkable. And I wanted to
advance my career. So I started

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.410
ACC the online program was
appealing to me because I knew

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.680
that I could work around my work
schedule. You know, I'm a full

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.770
time mom, I'm a full time
employee. So I knew that I

25
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
needed something that I could
manipulate the schedule and make

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.070
sure that I got the work done
how I needed to and when I

27
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.680
needed to. And the cost being
low, was also a huge input for

28
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.970
me. After graduating SCC, I did
transfer to a four year school

29
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.700
where I'm working towards
getting my bachelor's in

30
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.910
Business Administration. One
piece of advice I would give

31
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.050
anyone that was thinking about
taking online classes at SCC is

32
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.090
do it it is absolutely worth it.
