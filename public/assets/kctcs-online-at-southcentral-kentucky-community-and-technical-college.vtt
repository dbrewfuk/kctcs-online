Cooper: I love helping people
with struggles that everyone

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.020
has. There's always someone out
there that is there to help. And

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.440
I want to be that person that
helps. My name is Cooper Alls.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm at Sky CTC, which is South
Central Kentucky Community and

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.960
Technical College. I am studying
information security and

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.930
network. Being able to combine
the customer service as well as

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
being behind the scenes to be
able to help people in their

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
everyday life, keeping them
safe, the data safe, etc. And

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.400
that's what has really drawn me
into information security. Being

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.210
online and doing online classes
has always been a great thing

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.150
for me being able to have the
flexibility throughout the week.

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.120
If I need to go here, I can go
here. If I need to do this, I

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.510
can do this instead of having to
be tied down to go to class.

14
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.410
Being able to have a flexible
work life balance has given me a

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.980
great opportunity. I really
wanted to be able to get the in

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.330
person work experience. I was
able to be a part of the IT

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.510
internship that we had here on
campus, which has given me a

18
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.130
great opportunity to have in
person skills of how the

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.630
workforce within it come through
be able to get P knowledge base

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.180
that I did not get in the
classroom with the real world

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.430
experience, as well as get to
know some fabulous people being

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.260

education and being able to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.580
